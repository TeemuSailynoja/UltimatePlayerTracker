This subdirectory contains the implementation of YOLOv4 used for object detection and feature extraction in the context of DeepSORT-based object tracking.

## Purpose

YOLOv4 serves as the detection backbone for the DeepSORT framework. It provides bounding boxes and deep feature embeddings that enable accurate and efficient multi-object tracking.

## Structure

- **`backbone.py`**: Implements the feature extraction backbone of YOLOv4.
- **`common.py`**: Houses shared utility functions and reusable components.
- **`config.py`**: Contains configuration settings, including model parameters, dataset paths, training hyperparameters, and testing options.
- **`dataset.py`**: Manages dataset loading, preprocessing, and annotation parsing for training and evaluation.
- **`utils.py`**: Provides helper functions for bounding box manipulation, image preprocessing, post-detection filtering, and model layer management.
- **`yolov4.py`**: The main implementation file for the YOLOv4 model, including the architecture, training utilities, and components required for both training and inference workflows.

## Role in the Project

This directory focuses on detection and feature extraction for the broader DeepSORT project. After YOLOv4 generates detections and embeddings, the tracking logic in DeepSORT assigns unique IDs to detected objects, maintaining consistency across frames.

## Configuration and Usage

Refer to `config.py` to set model parameters, input/output paths, and other settings. Integrate this module with the tracking pipeline in the main project directory.
